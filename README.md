# mammogram-prediction-using-neural-networks

Predict whether a mammogram mass is benign or malignant. We'll be using the mammographic masses public dataset from the UCI repository.

Summary of the data:

This data contains 961 instances of masses detected in mammograms, and contains the following attributes:

   1. BI-RADS assessment: 1 to 5 (ordinal)  
   2. Age: patient's age in years (integer)
   3. Shape: mass shape: round=1 oval=2 lobular=3 irregular=4 (nominal)
   4. Margin: mass margin: circumscribed=1 microlobulated=2 obscured=3 ill-defined=4 spiculated=5 (nominal)
   5. Density: mass density high=1 iso=2 low=3 fat-containing=4 (ordinal)
   6. Severity: benign=0 or malignant=1 (binominal)


# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Keras

Recurring Neural Networks using Keras-Sentiment analysis from movie reviews.

This notebook is inspired by the imdb_lstm.py example that ships with Keras.
It's actually a great example of using RNN's. The data set we're using consists of user-generated movie reviews and classification of whether the user liked the movie or not based on its associated rating.
